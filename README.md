# Tic Tac Toe

**Tic Tac Toe** is a classic two-player game implemented using different programming languages. This repository provides various implementations of the Tic Tac Toe game, both for human vs. human and human vs. computer modes, allowing players to play this simple yet fun game in their local environments.

This project aims to demonstrate the application of algorithms and logic in a popular game. It includes a user-friendly interface and provides an enjoyable gaming experience.

## Features

- **Human vs. Human Mode**: Two players take turns to mark X and O on the grid.
- **Human vs. Computer Mode**: A single player can play against the computer, which makes random moves or uses an algorithm to play more intelligently.
- **Grid Display**: The game board is displayed in a simple, text-based format, with clear marking of X and O.
- **Win Detection**: The game automatically detects when a player wins or if the game is a draw.
- **Multiple Language Implementations**: The game is implemented in different programming languages.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For the basic implementation of the game with a simple text interface.
- **JavaScript**: For building an interactive version of the game that can be run in a web browser.
- **Java**: For demonstrating an object-oriented approach to the game with player interactions.
- **C++**: For a performance-focused implementation of the game.
